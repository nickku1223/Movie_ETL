# Movie_ETL

# Purpost of this project
This project is about the data Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process. Often we have data from sources where the data isn't in consistent form and ready to perform analysis, such as the movies data in this project, which are from Wikipedia and Kaggle. The data was messy and hard to read, and very difficult if not impossible to perfrom analysis with its original form, so this project we use Python and jupyter notebook to perform the appropriate transformations.

This project also introduce regular expression, which can be a powerful tool for cleaning, searching and matching data. In the process, we create functions for the cleaning process, ultimatly made a function which contain other functions, for the different steps of the cleaning process. 

Finally, we import the cleaned data to PostgreSQL server using Python and modules such as Pandas, sqlalchemy.
